## 🧠 Why I Built This

As a Customer Success leader, I’ve often seen valuable internal knowledge scattered across Confluence pages, Slack threads, and tribal memory. This app provides a central hub to organize and retrieve reusable content—while also helping me relearn React fundamentals in a focused, CS-aligned way.
